# Bharath Intern Task
# TASK-1 :
# Titanic Survival Prediction :
      Project steps :
      1. Imported Libraries : Utilized some important libraries like pandas , NumPy, seaborn , matplotlib for data handling and analysis
      2. Data Collection : data is collected from the website KAGGLE.
      2. Data Exploration : Explored and analyzed data through some methods in pandas like describe,info etc
      3. Data Analysis : Analyzed each feature and their effects on output variable using matplotlib, seaborn
      4. Data Cleaning : Handled missing values ,outliers and ensured data quality by removing duplicates.
      5. Feature Selection : selected relevent features according to the output variable.
      6. Train test split : Divide the data into train and test data to evaluate model performance
      7. Pre-Processing : Converted categorical columns into numericalusing Standard Scaler..
      8. Model implementation : Implemented Classification model NaiveBayes for the model fitting and predicting
      9. model fitting annd predict : Trained NaiveBayes model on training data and tested on test data.
      10. Model Evaluation : Asssessed the model's accuracy and performance using Confusion matrix and Roc Curve.
